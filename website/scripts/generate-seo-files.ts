/**
 * Runs after `vite build` (see package.json) to drop sitemap.xml, robots.txt
 * and llms.txt into the prerendered output.
 *
 * All three read `SECTIONS` / `ALL_PAGES` — the same list the sidebar, the
 * pager and the root route's canonical URLs already read — so a page added
 * there is a page added here, with nothing to keep in sync by hand. The
 * playground is deliberately left out: its pages already carry
 * `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` because their state lives in the
 * query string, not in a page worth indexing.
 *
 * This runs as a plain Node script, outside Vite, so it cannot read
 * `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` the way `src/lib/seo.ts` does — the base is
 * read the same way vite.config.ts reads it, straight from `DOCS_BASE`, and
 * the domain is repeated from `SITE_ORIGIN` there rather than imported,
 * since importing it would also pull in that Vite-only global.
