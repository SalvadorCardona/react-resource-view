 * The outline column of a builder screen: the record's own fields, folded away,
 * and under them the blocks it is assembled from.
 *
 * A post is a title, an author, a category — and a document. Drawn as one flat
 * form they are the same thing, so six fields of metadata pushed the blocks
 * below the fold on the screen the reader came to build a page on. Here they
 * are a `Settings` fold, open while the post is being created, closed once it
 * exists and the writing is what is left to do.
 *
 * Both components below are the ones `FormInterface.components` already names:
 * no rendering is taken away from the library, it is asked for a different
 * arrangement of the very inputs it built.
