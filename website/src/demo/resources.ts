/**
 * The two resources every view demo on this site is built on.
 *
 * They are declared once, at module scope, because `createViewResource` writes
 * into the shared resource registry: declaring the same IRI twice from two
 * pages would register it twice. Each page then picks a layout instead of
 * declaring a resource of its own.
 *
 * None of them has a `path`: they read and write the browser's storage, which
 * `seedDemoData` fills, so every demo runs with no server behind it. Nor do
 * they declare `permissions`: everything is allowed by default, and the demos
 * want the whole CRUD surface.
