/**
 * The resources of the playground's back office, one file each.
 *
 * They are declared in modules rather than in a page because
 * `createViewResource` writes into the shared resource registry — declaring
 * the same IRI twice would register it twice. Only the scope and the builder
 * import them, and the playground loads the scope lazily: a reader who never
 * opens the administration never downloads any of this.
 *
 * Importing this module is what opens the back office, and a view fetches as
 * soon as it mounts — so this is the last moment the fixtures can be written.
 * The builder screen goes through here too: it saves into these resources, and
 * a reader who lands on it first is just as much a first visit.
