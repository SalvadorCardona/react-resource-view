/**
 * The records of the back office that are documents rather than fields: the
 * pages of the site, and the CV an account amounts to.
 *
 * Written the way the builder writes its own samples — see `BUILDER_KITS` in
 * `@/demo/builder/kits`: a block is an object whose `type` is the `@for` tag of
 * the form that draws it, and every picture is an id of the media library
 * rather than a URL, so the fixtures load with the page and survive offline.
 *
 * They exist because a page builder with nothing in it demonstrates nothing: a
 * list has no layouts to switch between, no filter to try and no record to
 * open. These are the same shape the builder saves, so a page published from
 * `/playground/builder` lands next to them and reads exactly alike.
 *
 * The types come from `adminData`, which reads these back in turn — only ever
 * as types, so nothing is imported in both directions at runtime.

/**
 * The pages of the site, stored as posts.

 * blocks — so they live in the same collection, under the "Pages" category.
 * Their ids continue the articles', which is what keeps two rows of one
 * collection from sharing an IRI.
