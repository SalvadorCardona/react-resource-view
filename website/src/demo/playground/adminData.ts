 * a scope is for — an administration is a menu of resources, and a single list would never show it.
 *

 * None of these resources declares a `path`, so `createViewResource` falls back
 * to the localStorage repository: the whole back office is genuinely writable,
 * and the changes survive a reload — see `seedAdminData`.
