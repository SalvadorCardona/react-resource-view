      <P>
        An email builder is the example people ask for right after a{" "}
        <A href="/docs/form/asymmetric">page builder</A>, and the form half of it is
        the same: one array field, a palette of block types, a payload of typed
        objects. What changes is the other half. A page is drawn by components; an
        email is a string of HTML that leaves the application and is drawn by Gmail,
        Outlook or Apple Mail — each with its own, much smaller idea of CSS.
      </P>

      <H2 id="same-field">The same field, another palette</H2>

      <P>
        Eight block types — header, hero, text, button, image, two columns, divider
        and footer — each registered with <C>addForm</C> and tagged{" "}
        <C>email-block</C>. The field offers whatever carries that tag, exactly as{" "}
        <C>page-block</C> builds the landing page's palette.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock filename="emailBlocks.ts">{BLOCK}</CodeBlock>

      <H2 id="envelope">An envelope beside the blocks</H2>

      <P>
        An email has things that are not content: a subject, the grey preheader that
        follows it in the inbox, a sender name, a brand colour. They are not blocks —
        there is exactly one of each — so they are plain fields of the form, next to{" "}
        <C>blocks</C>. The payload becomes an object rather than a bare array, which
        is also the shape a newsletter is stored in.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock filename="emailForm.ts">{FORM}</CodeBlock>

      <H2 id="demo">The builder, running</H2>

      <P>
        The preview is not a set of React components that look like an email: it is
        the HTML <C>renderEmail</C> returns, in an <C>&lt;iframe srcdoc&gt;</C> that
        keeps the site's stylesheet out. What is on screen is what would be sent. The
        HTML and the plain-text part are one tab away, the weight is beside them, and
        Desktop / Mobile resize the frame to 600 and 375 pixels.
      </P>

      <Demo label="A newsletter — the envelope folds into Settings" wide>
        <BuilderStudio kit={EMAIL_KIT} />
      </Demo>

      <P>
        The <A href="/playground/builder">playground</A> runs it at full size and
        saves into a Newsletters resource of its back office, edited there with the
        same builder.
      </P>

      <H2 id="render">Rendering is a pure function</H2>

      <P>
        <C>renderEmail</C> takes the envelope and the blocks and returns the HTML,
        the text part and the weight in bytes. It imports nothing — no React, no DOM,
        no Tailwind — so the browser preview, the export button, the test script and
        the unit tests all run the same code, and the file can be copied into another
        project as it stands.
      </P>

      <H2 id="why">Why it looks like 2005</H2>

      <P>
        The CSS every mail client agrees on is small, so the output is written in it
        and nothing else:

          <strong>Tables for layout.</strong> A 600px column in{" "}
          <C>&lt;table role="presentation"&gt;</C>, fluid below that. Outlook on
          Windows renders with Word, which knows neither flexbox nor grid; the two
          columns are inline blocks that wrap on a phone without a media query.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>Inline styles.</strong> On every element. The one{" "}
          <C>&lt;style&gt;</C> in the head adds the phone layout and a dark palette,
          and the message still reads correctly when a client drops it.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>Hosted images.</strong> Gmail blocks SVG and <C>data:</C> URIs, so
          the builder's SVG library is rasterised to PNG by a script and served by
          the site. Every <C>&lt;img&gt;</C> has an absolute URL, a width, a height
          and an alt text.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>A bulletproof button.</strong> A padded link inside a coloured
          cell, with a VML shape for Outlook on Windows, which ignores padding on
          links.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>Nothing typed becomes markup.</strong> Every field is escaped, and
          the rich text is reduced to <C>p</C>, <C>br</C>, <C>strong</C>, <C>em</C>,{" "}
          <C>a</C>, <C>ul</C>, <C>ol</C> and <C>li</C>, styled inline.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>Light and dark.</strong> <C>color-scheme</C> is declared, the
          palette avoids pure black and white, and a logo sits on a ground of its own
          so an inverted mailbox does not swallow it.

      <P>
        A preview proves the HTML; only a mailbox proves the email. The site is
        static and public, so it sends nothing — a form that mailed what it was given
        would be a relay for spam. A script sends from a developer's machine instead,
        through Brevo or any SMTP server, reading its credentials from the
        environment and masking them in its output.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock lang="bash">{SEND}</CodeBlock>

      <P>
        Until the PNGs are deployed a mailbox cannot fetch them, so the script
        attaches them inline and points the images at <C>cid:</C> — the reason{" "}
        <C>assetBaseUrl</C> accepts that value. The full recipe — the files to copy,
        the checklist for Gmail, Outlook and mail-tester — is in the{" "}
        <A href="https://github.com/SalvadorCardona/react-resource-view/tree/main/website/src/demo/email">
          README next to the renderer

      <Callout kind="warning" title="Not a sending service">
        <P>
          The builder makes the message, not the campaign: no list, no scheduling, no
          tracking, no bounce handling. Hand the HTML and the text part to whatever
          already sends your mail.

          <strong>102 KB.</strong> Past that weight Gmail clips the message and hides
          the rest — the footer and its unsubscribe link first. The builder shows the
          weight against that limit as you type.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>Uploads cannot go in an email.</strong> A file read in the browser
          is a <C>data:</C> URI; the email palette only offers the hosted library,
          and the renderer drops anything else.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>The unsubscribe link is required.</strong> In law for a marketing
          email, and in practice for Gmail; the footer block will not validate
          without it, and the test script repeats it as a <C>List-Unsubscribe</C>{" "}
          header.
