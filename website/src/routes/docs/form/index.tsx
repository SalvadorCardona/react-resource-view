      <P>
        <C>react-data-form</C> takes an object describing a form — its fields, their
        labels, what happens on submit — and renders it. It holds the state, runs the
        validators, and puts the violations your API returns back on the fields that
        caused them.
      </P>

      <H2 id="first-form">A first form</H2>

      <P>
        Two imports and one object. <C>useForm</C> builds the form and owns its
        state; <C>FormElement</C> renders the whole thing — header, fields, errors
        and submit button.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock filename="ProfileForm.tsx">{FIRST_FORM}</CodeBlock>

      <Demo label="The form above, running">
        <FormDemo
          form={{
            label: { title: "My profile", submit: "Save" },
            inputs: {
              firstName: { label: "First name", required: true },

      <P>
        The payload beside the form is what <C>onSubmit</C> receives. That is the
        whole contract: a description goes in, a plain object comes out.
      </P>

      <H2 id="why-data">Why data, not JSX</H2>

      <P>
        A form written as JSX can only be read by React. A form written as data can
        be stored in a database, merged with another one, filtered by permission, or
        generated from an OpenAPI schema — and only then handed to React.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock>{NOT_JSX}</CodeBlock>

      <P>
        This is also what lets <A href="/docs/resource-view">react-resource-view</A>{" "}
        build a table, an edit screen and a filter bar from the same object: the
        description is the single source, and every screen is a reading of it.
      </P>

      <Callout kind="tip" title="One field, one controller">
        Every field is rendered by a <em>controller</em> — a component receiving{" "}
        <C>{"{ formInput, onChange }"}</C> and nothing else. Forty-odd ship with the
        package, and writing your own takes about ten lines.
      </Callout>

      <H2 id="boundaries">What it does not do</H2>

      <P>
        The library is deliberately narrow. It has no opinion on where your data
        comes from or where it goes:
      </P>

      <Ul>
        <Li>
          <strong>No HTTP client.</strong> <C>onSubmit</C> receives an object; what
          you do with it is yours.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>No schema library.</strong> A field's <C>validator</C> is a
          function that throws. Zod errors are understood, but nothing forces you to
          use Zod.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>No router.</strong> A form is a component, not a page.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <strong>No visual identity.</strong> The components use Tailwind classes
          backed by the shadcn theme variables, so they take your palette rather than
          imposing one.
