      <Callout kind="note" title="The first one wins">
        <P>
          With no <Term id="view-variant">layout</Term> in the URL, the first of the
          list is used. Ordering them is how you choose the default, and a layout id
          that no longer exists falls back to it rather than rendering nothing.
        </P>
      </Callout>

      <H2 id="header">The header of a list</H2>

      <P>
        The switcher is not a loose control floating above the rows: every list draws
        one header line, and the switcher sits in it. From left to right — the
        resource's <C>icon</C> in a badge, the view's title — derived from the
        resource&apos;s <C>name</C> — and <C>description</C>, the layout switcher, then the export and create buttons,
        with a rule under the lot.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock>{HEADER}</CodeBlock>

      <P>
        Nothing is declared to turn it on. It is assembled from what the resource
        already says, and each piece disappears when there is nothing to draw: no{" "}
        <C>icon</C>, no badge; no <C>description</C>, one line instead of two; one
        layout, no switcher; <C>permissions.create</C> refused, no button.
      </P>

      <Callout kind="note" title="A nested list keeps quiet">
        <P>
          A list rendered inside another view — a{" "}
          <A href="/docs/resource-view/sub-views">tab</A>, a resource
          embedded in a page of your own — leaves the naming out: whatever contains it
          has already written its title, and saying it twice is only saying it twice.
          Its switcher and its buttons stay.
        </P>
      </Callout>

      <P>
        The icon shown is the resource's, not the layout's. A layout carries an icon
        of its own — it is what the switcher draws — and a header taking that one
        would change the heading of the collection every time the reader changed the
        layout.
      </P>

      <P>
        The filter bar is not part of it: it is a row of its own, below the rule, and
        it has <A href="/docs/resource-view/filters">its own page</A>.
      </P>

      <H2 id="identity">How a layout is identified</H2>

      <P>
        A layout&apos;s id is its type, so renaming its <C>label</C> breaks no
        shared link. Pass an <C>id</C> only when the same layout appears twice.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock>{IDENTITY}</CodeBlock>

      <H2 id="shared">What every layout shares</H2>

      <P>
        Besides its own options — <C>columns</C>, <C>groupBy</C>,{" "}
        <C>dateField</C>… — every layout accepts the same few, and only for that
        layout:
      </P>

      <Ul>
        <Li>
          <C>fields</C> — the columns of the table, the lines of a card, in order:{" "}
          <C>fields: ["title", "status"]</C>. Checked against the item type.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <C>form</C> — adjusts the resource&apos;s form for this layout only, merged
          over it.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <C>fullWidth</C> — this layout takes the page&apos;s whole width.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <C>label</C>, <C>icon</C> — what the switcher shows; <C>id</C> — what the
          URL says.
        </Li>
        <Li>
          <C>components.list</C>, <C>components.row</C>, <C>components.item</C>.
        </Li>
      </Ul>

      <P>
        Those three rendering slots are what a layout actually sets:{" "}
        <C>components.list</C> draws the collection, <C>components.row</C> one
        record, and <C>components.item</C> one field of a record. What belongs to
        the list rather than to one layout — <C>pageSize</C>, <C>filters</C>,{" "}
        <C>sort</C>, <C>bulkActions</C>, <C>components.top</C>,{" "}
        <C>components.empty</C> — is declared on <C>views.list</C>, and holds
        whichever layout the reader picks.
      </P>

      <H2 id="custom">Writing your own</H2>

      <P>
        A built-in layout is a preset over the same shape as{" "}
        <C>layout.custom()</C>, nothing more. A layout of your own is three
        components and one call:
      </P>

      <CodeBlock>{CUSTOM}</CodeBlock>

      <P>
        Inside those components, <C>useList</C> gives the rows and the mutations, and{" "}
        <C>useCurrentViewResourceContext</C> gives the whole context — loading state,
        filters, selection — and <C>useLayout().options</C> the layout&apos;s own
        options.
      </P>

      <P>
        You need not type any of it: the package ships a command that writes that
        file where you want it, components and <C>layout.custom()</C> call included.
      </P>

      <CodeBlock lang="bash">{SCAFFOLD}</CodeBlock>

        <A href="/docs/resource-view/custom-variant">

        takes the generated file apart, line by line.
      </P>

      <P>
        The next three pages take the built-in layouts one family at a time:{" "}
