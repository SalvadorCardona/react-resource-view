/**
 * The documentation site is a TanStack Start application: the prose is rendered
 * ahead of the reader, the demos are mounted in the browser.
 *
 * Start was picked over a generic SSR framework because `react-resource-view`
 * keeps its whole view context in the URL and ships a TanStack Router adapter.
 * Running the site on that router means the demos exercise the same navigation
 * port the documentation recommends, instead of a bespoke one written for the
 * site.
 *
 * The build prerenders every route to static HTML so the site can be served by
 * GitHub Pages, which has no server to render on request. `pnpm start` still
 * runs the same application with a live server — the two differ in *when* the
 * HTML is produced, not in what produces it.
 */

 * Where the site is served from. GitHub Pages serves a project site under
 * /<repository>/, not at the domain root, so the base has to reach the router,
 * the asset URLs and the links the view package builds.
