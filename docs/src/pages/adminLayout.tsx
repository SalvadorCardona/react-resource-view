            The menu drives everything: an entry with <code>items</code> becomes a
            collapsible group, and one with <code>subNavigation: true</code> opens on
            its first page while the header shows the sibling pages as tabs instead
            of nesting them in the sidebar.

            An absolute <code>href</code> opens in a new tab. Without either option
            the sidebar has no footer; on a phone, both go behind a last entry of the
            bottom bar, which opens them in a drawer.

            The name is read from <code>title</code>, <code>name</code> or{" "}
            <code>label</code>; a view names another field with <code>titleKey</code>
            . The same name ends the breadcrumb in the top bar, after the scope's{" "}

          <p>
            The most specific declaration wins: the list variant on screen, then the
            action&apos;s entry in <code>views</code>, then the resource&apos;s{" "}
            <code>view</code>. Nothing declared means the column, so a resource that
            never mentions it is drawn as before. A <code>decoratorComponent</code>{" "}
            of your own reads the same option with <code>isFullWidthView</code>. The{" "}
