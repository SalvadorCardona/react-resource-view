 *
 * The views know a resource has a path, rows, pages and filters; they know
 * nothing of the shape a given backend gives those. A dialect holds that
 * knowledge — the URL an item lives at, the query string a filter becomes, the
 * envelope a collection comes back in, where the validation errors hide — so
 * the same declared resource renders against API Platform, Strapi or Supabase.
 *
 * Three ship with the package:
 * {@link jsonLdDialect}, {@link strapiDialect} and {@link supabaseDialect}.
 * Anything else is one object away.
