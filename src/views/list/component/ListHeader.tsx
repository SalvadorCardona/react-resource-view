 * The header of a list: what the collection is, and what can be done with it.
 *
 * One line holds the three answers a list owes its reader — which resource is
 * on screen, in which layout, and how to add to it — instead of the stack of
 * loose controls it used to be. The resource's `icon` is what makes it read as
 * a heading rather than a toolbar: the same mark the menu and the tabs already
 * use, so a reader arriving from the navigation lands on something they
 * recognise.
 *
 * The filters are deliberately left out: they are a row of their own, below,
 * and they scroll.
